This chatbot is a locally deployed, intelligent Q&A assistant built to answer questions related to mental health trends in the workplace. It is powered by semantic search and is designed using sentence-transformer embeddings (MiniLM-L6-v2) combined with FAISS, a high-speed vector similarity search engine. The chatbot draws its knowledge from an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) summary generated from the OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey (2017–2021). When a user asks a question, the chatbot retrieves the most relevant insights by matching the query against preprocessed and vectorized EDA content. It returns the top 1–2 contextually related chunks, giving quick, accurate, and supportive responses. The interface is deployed using Streamlit, providing a clean, chat-like experience with preserved conversation history. If a highly relevant match isn’t found, the bot offers empathetic fallback advice. Overall, this chatbot serves as an interactive, informative tool to raise awareness about mental health in tech.
